# Euler-Method
Euler method is one of the numeric integration methods to solve ordinary differential equation (ODE). In this package, the euler method is implemented in Fortran program. There are three files in this package:
  1. euler.f95
  2. euler.m (Matlab)
  3. euler_plot.png
# How To Use?
The function of f(x) = 2-(exp(-4x))-(2y) is used to solve the intergration problem in this case. To plot the result, you can use euler.m (Matlab) file.

There are three parameters input have to set, for example:
  - Initial Boundary = 0
  - Final Boundary = 5
  - Set Data Point = 0.1
